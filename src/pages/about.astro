        I've been interested in technology since a very young age and I started
        programming when I was about 11 years old. Since then I've been learning
        and working with different technologies and languages. Starting with
        making Minecraft Plugins in Java and later switching to Kotlin for that.
        I focus on expanding my skills for building things on the Internet now.
        A good example for that is this website, which I built myself!

        Political Activism

        While I enjoy sotware development a lot, the world is a place of
        corruption, exploitation and injustice. I am convinced that we can and
        should do better. We should all fight for a better world without
        capitalism, fascism, discrimination and oppression. To bring my ideas
        into politics, I am on the federal board of <a

        make it harder to concentrate on my excitement for technology and
        software development, but sometimes I still get to realize cool
        projects. Usually I write about this and my personal life on <a
