## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my brand new and polished website! <br />

## Why the old one had to go

My old website has been around for quite a bit, and I've been meaning to update it for a while now.
It was quite outdated now, and the code for it was also not that great. <br />
It was also built with Vue, which wasâ€¦ not that great for SEO. <br />
When I made it, I was rather new to the JavaScript world and I didn't know much about Vue. You could also see that in the Code. <br />

## What's new?

This new website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), which is an awesome static site generator, so perfect for a Personal Website with mostly/only static content. <br />
If I ever want to add some dynamic content, I can do that with Astro as well. It lets me use any JavaScript framework I want, and if I want to use none, I can do that as well.
Astro has built in support for Server Side Rendering.

Since Astro itself doesn't do any Client Side Rendering, but I really wanted to do the transitions between pages that you might have noticed, I had to think of something else. <br />
Looking around, I found [Swup.js](https://swup.js.org), which was a perfect fit for what I wanted. <br />

So there we have it â€“ a new website with a new design, new code and new technologies. <br />
It is also Open Source and you can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/StckOverflw/stckoverflw.net). <br />

## What's next?

One thing I really wanted to build this new website for, was to have a blog. <br />
I'm planning on writing a bit about my projects & tech in general, my thoughts about politics and other things that interest me.

## Conclusion

I don't really know what else to say here other than that I hope you like the new website. If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StckOverflw) or join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/WWwNTDdXx2)!
